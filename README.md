#Feed Reader Testing
## Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. I then used [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a series of tests on the application.

## Getting Started
 To run, simply clone the git repo and run the index file in the web browser of your choice.
